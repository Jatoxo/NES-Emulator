# _NAME TO BE DETERMINED_ - NES Emulator 

A beeeg stoopid emulador in java  
_This emulator is in its infancy and can only run the most basic games as of writing this. Before any 
UI is tackled it will first be made to work with most games. Inputs are hardmapped._

# Philosophy

#### UI
 - I am aiming to create an emulator with an intuitive user interface
 - modern playtime tracking and library management
#### Accuracy
 - This emulator is not particularly accurate
#### Speed
 - Java
#### Code
 - The code isn't particularly easy to read
 - *I am bad*
